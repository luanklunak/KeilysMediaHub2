Photography has always been a way for people to capture moments in time and share them with others. While smartphones have become 
the go-to tool for photography, i feel there is something special about using a dedicated camera to capture fun moments. Using a 
old-school camera allows for a more intentional and creative approach to photography. It encourages me to put more thought
 into composition and subject matter, resulting in more interesting and engaging photos. 
<br><br>
Beyond the technical aspects, using a regular camera for fun photography is a truly enjoyable experience. 
 It 
disconnects one from the constant distractions of a smartphone and allows for greater focus on the moment being
 captured. Experimenting with different cameras (digital or film), and developing techniques can also add a layer of 
 excitement and discovery to the process. 
<br><br>
Ultimately, using photography to capture fun moments is about more than just the final images to me. 
It is about the joy of the process, the satisfaction of creating something beautiful, and the ability 
to share those moments with others. Whether it is a vintage film camera, a Polaroid instant camera, 
or a modern digital camera, stepping away from the smartphone feels good.

    The article "No One Is Ready" by Sarah Jeong explores how easily accessible 
    AI image manipulation tools like Googles Magic Editor is and how it affects the faith we have on images. 
    Jeong argues that the ease with which realistic fake photos can be created will fundamentally 
    change how society views photographs, shifting the default assumption from truth to potential 
    fabrication. She believes this will have far-reaching consequences as photographs have 
    historically served as crucial evidence in legal proceedings and social movements.
    <br><br>
    Jeong highlights the danger of this paradigm shift by citing examples like the Kyle Rittenhouse
     trial, where the defense questioned the authenticity of a zoomed-in iPhone footage. She argues that 
     the nature of AI-generated imagery will make it increasingly difficult to discern truth 
     from falsehood, potentially leading to a world where even the most egregious events are dismissed
      as fabrications. This, she concludes, marks a troubling erosion of social consensus and shared 
      reality, where an images traditional role as a reliable record of events is 
      undermined.

    The Al Jazeera graphic novel, "Motherhood in Crisis," sheds light on 
    the dire state of maternal healthcare in Sierra Leone. The comic series features four women: 
    Memunatu, Heela, Kadiatu, and Tettehwho who share their heavy experiences of pregnancy and 
    childbirth in a country where one in ten women die during childbirth. The fragility of their 
    healthcare system, weakend by outbreaks like Ebola and COVID-19, along with limited access
     to basic treatment, contribute to the high maternal mortality rate.
     <br><br>
This story emphasizes the 
urgent need for improved healthcare infrastructure and access. The graphic novel format allows readers 
to engage with these women's personal narratives, fostering a deeper understanding of the importance of proper 
 maternal healthcare and prompting reflection on the global disparities in access to 
essential medical services.

            The AI Artist Who Used Bad Bunny's Voice

<br>

    The "AI Artist Who Used Bad Bunny's Voice" article tells the story of Mauricio Bustos, a Chilean musician who gained
     notoriety with FlowGPT by creating AI-generated music using the voices of 
     famous artists like Bad Bunny, Justin Bieber, and Daddy Yankee. While his work gained millions 
     of streams and went viral on platforms like TikTok and Spotify, it drew a lot of controversy, 
     particularly from Bad Bunny himself, who publicly condemned the use of his AI-generated voice
      in the song "NostalgIA." 
      <br><br>
Despite the backlash, Bustos sees AI as a democratizing tool that empowers independent artists 
and challenges of the industry. He argues that AI allows artists to 
experiment with different voices and styles, creating “demos” that can potentially be re-recorded by
 established artists. However, the legal and ethical implications of AI-generated music remain murky,
  as artists and industry stakeholders have questions of copyright infringement, artist 
  compensation, and the authenticity of creative expression. The article highlights the disruptive 
  potential of AI in the music industry and the ongoing debate surrounding its use and impact on artists
   and the creative process.
